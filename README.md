Voltos (https://voltos.io) is a secure credentials-as-a-service platform for app and system developers.

Voltos stores your credentials (e.g. API keys, usernames, passwords, tokens, configuration settings) in a secure, central location - so that your apps can access them securely as environment variables, and you can more easily manage & access them.
